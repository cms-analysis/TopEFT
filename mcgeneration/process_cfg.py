# add multiple processes.
#
# default header of the proc_card.dat will look like:

# please choose one of the following options
# 	no_reweights: no reweighting is applied
#	individual: each operator is varied individually
# 	rnd_scan: a random scan over all operators is performed
#	grid: a rectangular grid of Wilson coefficients is scanned
#	custom: a custom reweighting scheme is provided by the user
#
